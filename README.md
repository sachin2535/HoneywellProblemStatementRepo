### Problem Description
<p>Input will be provided by the user. The input will be an array of temperatures in the range of 30 to
100. Array size can be from [1 to 3000]. Return a list such that for each day in the input, you need to
find after how many days there is a warmer day. If there is no future day possible, put 0 for that day. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p> Given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], </p>
<p></p>your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].</p>
